This is a data set of some games from League of Legends. The games were collected from EUW region, patch 10.8. 

I used Riot Developer portalto do so.

I plan to do analysis on this data, to get an idea of how to maximize the chances of winning by picking a certain champion or
team composition.

I upload this dataset so hopefully you can recommend me other information that could be included in this dataset. My main 
goal is to predict the chances of winning given the champion and the user. With that information I find the mastery points, and
that's how I included it on the dataset. 

Also, as I am new here, feel free to give me any advice you may have to make this project advance.

Thank you!
